# single-layer-perceptron

You can see implementations of some basic singlelayer perceptrons for Boolean functions in this MS Visual Studio project. The code is written in C++ and is full of my commentaries.

## Overview

The list of implemented pereptrons:
 * AND Perceptron
 * OR Perceptron

You can see the technical views of these implemented perseptrons below. The upper singlelayer perceptron realizes an AND, the lower one realizes an OR.

## Getting started

To see the program in action, you should follow these steps:
1. `$ git clone ` the repo.
2. Open the project in MS Visual Studio and build it.
3. `cd ` to the directory of your executable in console.
4. Run `slp help` for futher instuctions.
